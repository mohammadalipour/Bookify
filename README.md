# Bookify: A Booking Microservice System

Bookify is a booking microservice system built with NestJS, designed to handle bookings for various services such as hotel reservations, event tickets, appointments, and more. This README provides an overview of the project structure, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Features

- **Microservice Architecture**: Bookify is designed as a collection of independent microservices, each responsible for a specific domain or functionality.
- **RESTful APIs**: Communication between microservices is achieved via RESTful APIs, allowing for easy integration and scalability.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Bookify implements robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to resources.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Bookify utilizes a message broker for asynchronous communication between microservices, enabling loose coupling and resilience.
- **Data Persistence**: Bookify uses appropriate databases for each microservice, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of data.
- **Testing and CI/CD**: Bookify includes comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, along with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Bookify implements logging, monitoring, and alerting mechanisms to track system health and performance.
- **Scalability and Optimization**: Bookify is designed for scalability and performance optimization, utilizing caching, horizontal scaling, and load balancing techniques.

## Project Structure

The Bookify project consists of the following microservices:

- **Booking Service**: Responsible for managing bookings.
- **User Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization.
- **Inventory Service**: Manages the inventory of available resources/services.
- **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users regarding booking status changes.
- **Payment Service**: Handles payment processing for bookings.

Each microservice is implemented as a separate NestJS application, following a modular and scalable architecture.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the Bookify project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mohammadalipour/Bookify`
2. Install dependencies for each microservice: `cd bookify && npm install`
3. Configure environment variables: Update `.env` files in each microservice directory with appropriate configurations.
4. Start each microservice: `npm start` or `npm run start:dev` for development mode.

Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your system before proceeding.

## Usage

Once the microservices are up and running, you can interact with Bookify through its RESTful APIs. Refer to the API documentation for each microservice for detailed usage instructions.
